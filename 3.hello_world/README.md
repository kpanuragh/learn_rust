##   Hello, World! in Rust

This file demonstrates the classic "Hello, World!" program written in Rust and explains its functionality step-by-step.

**Code:**


```
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`fn main() { ... }`:**  This defines the main function, which is the entry point of the program.
2.  **`println!("Hello, World!");`:**  This line uses the  `println!`  macro to print the string "Hello, World!" to the console.
    -   `println!`  is a macro that takes a format string and arguments to be printed.
    -   In this case, the format string is just  `"Hello, World!"`, which means it will be printed verbatim.

**Compiling and Running:**

1.  **Save the code as `hello_world.rs`.**
    
2.  **Open a terminal or command prompt.**
    
3.  **Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.**
    
4.  **Run the following command to compile the code:**
    
    
    ```
    rustc hello_world.rs
    
    ```
    
    
    This will create an executable file named `hello_world` (or `hello_world.exe` on Windows).
    
5.  **Run the compiled program:**
    
    
    ```
    ./hello_world
    
    ```
    
    This will print "Hello, World!" to the console.
    

**Key Points:**

-   This is a simple example, but it demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of Rust code.
-   Rust is a statically typed language, which means you need to specify the data types of variables.
-   Rust is known for its memory safety and performance.
